Online PDF crop tool
Free and easy to use online tool for visual PDF document cropping / changing canvas size. With this tool, you can easily crop scans, Flipkart labels, logos, and any other PDFs.
You can crop the PDF to a selected area or choose the Auto-crop option, to try and remove all margins automatically. You can also use PDF cropper to increase visible margins, for example, to add extra space for annotations, by choosing the Extend margins option.
How to Crop a PDF
1. Upload your document. If you wish to upload multiple files simultaneously, please ensure that they are of the same size and margins.
2. If you want to select the part of the document for cropping manually, mark it in the preview window and then choose the Crop to selection option.
3. Choose Auto-crop to trim all the white margins automatically.
4. It is important to note that all pages in the processed documents will be cropped equally. If you require different parts of each page to be cropped, we recommend splitting the file before manually cropping each page.
Cropping Options
* Crop to selection: Visually select the area you want to keep using the interactive cropping tool.
* Auto-crop: Automatically detect and remove white margins around the page content.
* Extend margins: Add extra whitespace around the page edges — useful for binding margins or annotation space.
All files are processed on our server and automatically deleted within 1 hour of upload.

Need to make more changes? Try our PDF resize tool to change the resolution, rotate pages, or split the document into individual pages for per-page cropping.
