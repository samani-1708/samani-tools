How to make a PDF file editable?

If your PDF file was created digitally (for example, from Word or Excel), you can easily edit it on our platform: add text, sign, move pages, or insert images.
However, if it's a scanned document or image, it can't be edited as text. Although we don't offer OCR technology, you can add content on top of the PDF with text boxes, annotations, and visual elements as an alternative to modifying it.
